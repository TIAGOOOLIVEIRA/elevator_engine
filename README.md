# Elevator Control System


## Goal

This control system provide an interface for:
 1. Querying the state of the elevators (what floor are they on and where
    they are going),
 2. receiving an update about the status of an elevator,
 3. receiving a pickup request,
 4. time-stepping the simulation.


# Challenges

Implementing a unique value sorted queue regarding to FCFS pattern (first-come,first-served) is the main key of this engine.
